**Howdy ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for checking my GitHub page!**

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 17 years of experience and comfortable working across the entire web stack including front-end, back-end (Node.js and PHP), and DevOps.

I work primarily with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and related technologies. I'm also doing PHP from time to time, please don't judge me for that, I'm only human.
