**Howdy ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for checking my GitHub page!**

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 18 years of experience and comfortable working across the entire web stack including front-end, back-end (Node.js and PHP), and DevOps/DevSecOps.

I work primarily with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and related technologies. I'm also doing PHP from time to time. Please don't judge me for that :smile:
