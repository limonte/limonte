**Howdy üëã Thank you for checking my GitHub page!**

I‚Äôm a software engineer with over 17 years experience and comfortable working across the entire web stack include front-end, back-end (Node.js and PHP) and devops.

Day-to-day I work primarily with JavaScript, TypeScript, React and related technologies.

I also enjoy helping other developers. Through helping other developers, I‚Äôve managed to be in the **top 1%** of Stack Overflow users ([profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1331425/limon-monte?tab=profile)).
